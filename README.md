![Awesome Agentic Commerce banner](media/banner.png)

> A curated list of awesome resources for agentic commerce — the protocols, MCP servers, tools, apps, APIs and services powering AI agents that shop, sell and transact. For store owners, developers, agencies and marketers building for the AI era.

Agentic commerce is the shift from humans clicking "buy" to AI agents that build carts, compare products, and complete checkout on a shopper's behalf — coordinated through open standards like the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This list gathers the best resources across every commerce platform — Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Adobe Commerce and open-source engines — for building, selling and growing in that world.

Each category also links a **📚 Further reading** file under [`articles/`](articles/) collecting the best writing on the topic from across the web. New to the space? Start with the [glossary](articles/glossary.md) — UCP vs ACP vs AP2 vs MCP, GEO/AEO, llms.txt and friends, in plain language. Store owners: begin with Understanding Agentic Commerce, then Agent Readiness & Testing and Marketing, SEO & GEO. Developers: head for the protocols, AI & MCP Servers and your platform's section.
